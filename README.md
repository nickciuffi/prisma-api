# Prisma-Express API

This is my first time using the Prisma ORM.
I had heard that Prisma was an awesome ORM to use with TypeScript and I did not get disapointed.
I really loved the way I could create Database connections, send data and receive data from it.
In my oppinion, Prisma is the best way to comunicate a TypeScript application with a database.
